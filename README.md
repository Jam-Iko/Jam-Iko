### Hej 👋

I am Python (Django) Developer from Kyiv, Ukraine.

I love programming, puzzles (hey-o CS50) and increasingly interested in cyber security. 

I am currently obtaining my second university degree with main focus on AI... or math, lots of math (quite a contrast to my initial degree in Cultural Studies 😄 ).

Switching onto a new career path at 30 is a challenge, but if I don't go after my dreams now, I am not sure I can teach my daughter to fight for her aspirations later (and switching at 50 would be a much greater challenge, nej?).

    Python3, SQL (Postgresql), HTML, CSS, Sass, Jinja2, C, JavaScript
